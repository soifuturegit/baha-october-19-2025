During this time, I've seen him learn quickly, grow in skill, and put consistent effort into the projects we've worked on together. We tackled a variety of tasks—some complex—and Baha showed adaptability and persistence throughout. He took on challenges with a problem-solving mindset and helped move several projects forward.

    feedback: "I managed Chishte directly for work for multiple digital products & was very impressed with the quality of his work & soft skills, compared to his peers. Chishte had fantastic communication skills, gave very timely updates, & communicated expected roadblocks well. He can handle sharp deadlines & responds well to feedback if his work doesn't hit the mark. He produces high quality of work pretty consistently & shows a strong desire to learn, grow, & be a go-getter."

    feedback: "I had the pleasure of working with Bahauddin while he managed our customer support for a decent period of time. I found Bahauddin to be extremely punctual, and over-delivering all the time & he was a treat to work with. He is fast, he is responsive & he delivers what's asked of him. I would highly recommend him."
