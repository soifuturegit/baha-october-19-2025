Personal Note for next Prompt: 

– Add the markdown feature to each blog post. 

– Can you please tell me why we use index.ts for some sections updates? and I see there is a component folder which we can use to update the data. So whats the difrerence between components folder and data folder index.ts file? I am little cofused here.
